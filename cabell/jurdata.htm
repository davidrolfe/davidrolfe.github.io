<P>If, like John Charteris,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell" target="_blank">
Mr. Cabell</a> is an Economist;
he is also, like Jurgen, a pawnbroker. And,
whatever economy he may show in parsimoniously
using his characters in as many different books as
their recorded ages and the credulity of his readers
permit, and in charitably reintroducing those characters
into not wholly unfamiliar plots; his display of
treasures at second-hand is more generous than that
of any rival since Hebrew was first spoken beneath
the triple emblem of the Medici. For in his books
are long-dead authors and unremembered heroes
and old, out-moded gods, garnered from the dust
heap of thrown-by years and here magically refurbished
and given a new lease on immortality. And
there is no form of antiquarian research more
remunerative in hard-won success and stimulating
frustration than that undertaken in this pawn shop
of dreams which bears upon its signboard the name
of <B>Jurgen</B>.</P>

<P>So, for a great many spare hours in the last six
years, I have wandered among these literary antiques,
studying them and seeking to discover something of
the lands and ages of their origin. I have sought them
in the indices of the encyclopedias, tracked them
down the finely printed columns of mythological dictionaries,
and found many of them shamefacedly
hiding upon the &quot;Children's Shelves&quot; where most
public libraries' meager wealth of folk-lore is stored.
Through tall volumes in history they have led me
and through quaintly worded myths and black tomes
on witchcraft. And in the end I have captured many
of them, depriving them of the renewed life
that Mr. Cabell gave them, have placed them in this
book, like dead trophies on a wall for anyone's
inspection.</P>

<P>And inspection, it must be confessed, may reveal
faults enough. Curiosity alone claims credit for the
notes that follow, and scholarship admits to no aid in
their composition. The question, simply, was whether
or not these strange names had ever existed anywhere
save in a Virginia gentleman's imagination. And, if
they did so exist, what light might their stories throw
upon the incidents of Jurgen's bold journey towards
futility. And the answers are such as a search through
the shelves of the nearest public libraries and the
book cases of my friends could furnish me. Whenever
it was possible, the particular phase of any subject
referred to in <B>Jurgen</B> has been stressed in the
note concerning it; failing that, I have set down as
much of the available knowledge as seemed interesting.
Naturally, no character out of folk-lore or mythology
could be ignored, but to those with whom
every educated reader might well be acquainted, I
have given only the smallest space. And, whenever a
character who plays an important part in any of Mr.
Cabell's other romances strays briefly into <B>Jurgen</B>,
I have pointed out where a further account of his
adventures may be found. Furthermore, with what
may indeed seem an excess of generosity, I have
called attention to certain aspects of the tale which
one, meeting the pawnbroker of Poictesme for the
first time, might easily overlook.</P>

<P>But I cannot, as Jurgen does, so glibly cite my
authorities. Long ago, when these notes were begun,
I had no thought of their publication and so kept no
record of their origins: later, when I began to jot
down my sources, it was only that I might find again
the books I had consulted. So the
<A HREF="jurdata.htm#Bibliography">Bibliography</A>
at the
end of this book must be innocent of such minute details
as places and dates of publication, and sometimes
even the authors' initials. In it, however, are listed
most of the books I have found useful; though some
have supplied me with material for one note only,
while others have furnished a score or more. A few
volumes, directly mentioned and quoted in the text,
are not included.</P>

<P>But some allusions were not to be found in any
book: there is not yet an end to searching after &quot;Cabell
references.&quot; Such strange fellows as Phorgemon
and Graemagog still remain elusive, while the exact
geographical location of Amneran Heath and Lacre
Kai might prove interesting. And when there is left
in <B>Jurgen</B> no more cause for searching, <I>Figures of
Earth</I>, besides offering nice problems in medieval
history, presents such charming mysteries as Suskind
and Freydis and the Zhar-Ptitza Bird.

<font color="#007000">
<I>[DR: There is a follow-up book,
<A HREF="foe.htm" TARGET="_top">Notes on <b>Figures of Earth</b></A>.]</i>
</font>

And there are
other romances concerning Poictesme which go even
further afield into the lands of myth. So he who
chooses may join me in this gay, troublesome task of
searching after the old, forgotten homes of all those
battered beauties of the earth, whose ghosts so
brightly move again through Mr. Cabell's pages.</P>

<P><B>1</B> [<I>xv</I>] <B>Authorities</B> &mdash; The authorities &ndash;
de Ruiz, Verville, B&uuml;lg, Lewistam, Codman, and Prote &ndash;
quoted by Mr. Cabell, are conspicuously absent from the
encyclopedias are probably faked. Of only one of them,
B&uuml;lg, have we any biographical details. Ben Ray Redman,
writing in <I>The Reviewer</I> for November 1921, on <I>B&uuml;lg
the Forgotten</I>, says that Gottfried Johannes B&uuml;lg was
born in Strasburg in 1753; was educated at the University of Leipsig; became famous
upon the publication of a monumental work, in 1782, on the
folk-lore of Poictesme; and died, in 1795, of heart failure. B&uuml;lg,
says Mr. Redman, stole the entire work from another scholar
and changed it materially, so as to give it more popular
appeal. Mr. Redman's article is obviously a hoax, an effort to carry
Mr. Cabell's joke one step further.</P>

The books which Mark hid away until after he was dead are
<I>The Mysterious Stranger</I>, published in 1916;
<I><A href="http://www.hannibal.net/twain/works/what_is_man_1906/" TARGET="_blank">What is Man</A></I>,
published in 1917;
his <I>Autobiography</I>, published (in part, at least) in 1924;

and <I><A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3190" TARGET="_blank">1601</A></I>,
which is in circulation, although perhaps too
obscene to be issued save in a very limited edition.</P>

<font color="#007000">

<P>[DR]: <I>The Mysterious Stranger</I> is a strange case. Twain made
three attempts over a span of many years to write this book. The first time, he wrote only a
single chapter. The next time he picked it up, he got farther, but did
not work through to an ending. The final attempt was complete; however
it was not polished or coherent, and meandered horribly. Presumably at
that point, late in his life, Twain was aware that what he wanted to write here was too
controversial to sell, and so he went on with it merely to experiment
and to suit himself. The executors of his estate found these
texts among his papers and decided to blend them into a
complete story, and they accomplished this by using the bulk of the
second version plus the ending of the third version plus some
additional re-writing. They then announced that they had "discovered"
an unpublished novel, which wasn't entirely true, but the result is
worth reading. This is the commonly available version, which can be
found in various reprints; 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451524586/" TARGET="_blank">here</A>
is one.
This is presumably the version that the
writer above was familiar with, and he probably did not know of the
liberties taken to make the book presentable.  The full text of the
three original versions is available from the University of
California Press under the title
<A HREF="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520270008/no-44-the-mysterious-stranger" TARGET="_blank">No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger</A>
(also available at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520242068/" target="_blank">
Amazon</a>).</P>

<P>The <I>Autobiography</I> was developed very self-indulgently: It was dictated to and
transcribed by a secretary, chapter by chapter, in no particular order other than Twain's free association.
The result frustrated most readers. In recent years, Charles Neider edited and chronologically arranged
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060955422/" TARGET="_blank">this</A>
edition. By the way, some of the particularly (for their day) controversial chapters (having to do with religion and social custom)
were marked with a request that they not be published until 100 years (or, in one
instance, 500 years) after Twain's death. This was ostensibly to protect his descendents from stigma.
However, by the 1950's, after numerous requests, his surviving daughter had
acquiesced to the publication of all of his writings. Some of these ended up in
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060518650/" TARGET="_blank">
Letters from the Earth</A>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poictesme" target="_blank"><B>Poictesme</B></a>
&mdash; This is a land
of Mr. Cabell's own invention, the geography of which is
hopelessly mixed, since it draws on many realms of the earth
and several of the imagination for its component parts.
In the earlier romances it is simply somewhere on the map
of Europe; in books dealing with a later time it is placed
definitely within the boundaries of France. Two maps of
Poictesme exist: one,
<A HREF="jurmap.htm" TARGET="_blank">drawn by Mr. Cabell</A>, is to be found
in
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1417928301/" TARGET="_blank">
James Branch Cabell</a>, by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Van_Doren" target="_blank">
Carl Van Doren</a>; and the
other,
<A HREF="jurmap.htm" TARGET="_blank">
drawn by Frank C. Pap&eacute;</a>,
may be had
in the form of an ordinary map for the wall. The
Pap&eacute; drawing is also used as a decoration on the
end-papers of the limited first edition of
<I>The Silver Stallion</I>.</P>

<font color="#007000">
<P>[MK]:

Cabell explains the origin of the name "Poictesme" in a short piece
called "A Note About Poictesme" which first appeared in the
large-paper illustrated edition (1926 or '28, I forget which) of <I>The
Silver Stallion</I>, and is reprinted in volume 18 of the Storisende
Edition.  At any rate, he tells us that it is a portmanteau word &ndash; a
word made by combining two other words, like breakfast + lunch =
brunch.  In this case it is the name of two provinces in France,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poitiers" target="_blank">Poitiers</a>
(medieval Poictiers) and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angoul%C3%AAme" target="_blank">Angoulesme</a>,
which are combined.  Not as interesting as
some of the anagrams, perhaps, but there are the bald facts.

In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Woodford" target="_blank">Jack Woodford</a>'s
autobiography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I8162A/" target="_blank">
<i>The Autobiography of Jack Woodford</i></a>, Woodford speaks extensively of his
friendship with Mr. Cabell, and relates various interesting tales and anecdotes. From Chapter 4:

<blockquote><p>...For a long time my friend James Branch Cabell, in his younger days, made a good
living whipping up genealogies for the <i>nouveau riche</i> all over the country. Later he wrote
eighteen volumes, stemming from <i>Jurgen</i>, of the biography of Dom Manuel in the Land of
Poictesme. I finally got intimate enough with Mr. Cabell on a visit to Virgina to ask him about this
proper noun "Poictesme".  He regarded me owlishly over the tops of his professorial
spectacles&nbsp;&mdash; he never learned to wear bifocals&nbsp;&mdash; and informed me that it was
the sound one made when he pursed his mouth to spit and ejected spittle with the use of the tongue
to make nuances of musical degree.</p>

<p>Poictesme is really the United States, mercifully in disguise, as the Bible disguises
everything...</p></blockquote>

<P>I recollected now how his face changed. "And what in heaven's name was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches%27_Sabbath" target="_blank">
Sabbat</a>?" Then he fidgeted, and crossed his legs the other way.</P>

<P>I replied: "Well! it was scarcely heaven's name that was invoked there,
if old tales are to be trusted. Traditionally, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches%27_Sabbath" target="_blank">
Sabbat</a> was a meeting
attended by all witches in satisfactory diabolical standing, lightly
attired in smears of various magical ointments; and their vehicle of
transportation to this outing was, of course, the traditional
broomstick. Good Friday," I continued, seeing they all seemed willing
enough to listen, "was the favorite date for these gatherings, which
were likewise held after dusk on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Eve" target="_blank">
St. John's Eve</a>, on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night" target="_blank">
Walburga's Eve</a>, and
on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween" target="_blank">
Hallowe'en Night</a>. The diversions were numerous: there was feasting,
music, and dancing, with the devil performing obligatos on the pipes or
a cittern, and not infrequently preaching a burlesque sermon. He usually
attended in the form of a monstrous goat; and &ndash; when not amorously
inclined, often thrashed the witches with their own broomsticks. The
more practical pursuits of the evening included the opening of graves,
to despoil dead bodies of finger- and toe-joints, and certain portions
of the winding-sheet, with which to prepare a powder that had strange
uses.... But the less said of that, the better. Here, also, the devil
taught his disciples how to make and christen statues of wax, so that by
roasting these effigies the persons whose names they bore would be
wasted away by sickness."</P>

<p>"Have you forgotten it is

Walburga's Eve</a>?" Makrisi said. Raimbaut did
not regret he could not see his servant's countenance. "Time was we
named it otherwise and praised another woman than a Saxon wench, but let
the new name stand. It is Walburga's Eve, that little, little hour of
evil! and all over the world surges the full tide of hell's desire, and
mischief is a-making now, apace, apace, apace. People moan in their
sleep, and many pillows are pricked by needles that have sewed a shroud.
Cry Eman hetan now, messire! for there are those to-night who find the
big cathedrals of your red-roofed Christian towns no more imposing than
so many pimples on a butler's chin, because they ride so high, so very
high, in this brave moonlight. Full-tide, full-tide!" Makrisi said, and
his voice jangled like a bell as he drew aside the curtain so that the
old knight saw into the room beyond.</p>

in this and other romances, seems to use Koshchei as the supreme deity
of the universe, the universal

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshchei" target="_blank">
Koshchei</a> is the personification of evil,
appearing sometimes in human shape and sometimes as a snake. In the legends
concerning him, he is generally discovered, imprisoned behind a forbidden
door, by a bridegroom prince. He tricks the prince into releasing him,
and promptly carries off the prince's fairy wife, who is rescued only
with the greatest difficulty.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshchei" target="_blank">
Koshchei</a> is not really deathless, but only
hard to kill; as his death lies in an egg, that is in a duck, that is in a

gave

who was devoured by the poison as soon as he put it on; so that, after enduring

redeemer of Poictesme, whose life history is set forth in <I>Figures of Earth</I>,
and whose metamorphosis from a rather fallible human being to a holy redeemer is
described in <I>The Silver Stallion</I>. According to <I>Figures of Earth</I>,
Jurgen was a small child when he saw Manuel die; according to this passage,
it seems, he was over twenty-one. <I>The Lineage of Lichfield</I> says that Manuel
was born 23&nbsp;December&nbsp;1213, and died 29&nbsp;September&nbsp;1239;
and that Jurgen was born 8&nbsp;April&nbsp;1235; which would make Jurgen four
years old at the time.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the apparent discrepancy above might be
explained by the fact that, technically, Manuel's reign extended through
the regency of Niafer and ended only in 1258, when Emmerick became of age
and succeeded his father as Count of Poictesme.</P>

Andronicus Comnenus</a>, emperor of the East, a sort of princely Don Juan,

rise to disorders amounting almost to civil war; Andronicus marched on

Constantinople</a> and was soon master of the situation. In 1180, having married
the daughter of Alexius, he was proclaimed co-emperor with him.
In 1183 he caused Alexius to be strangled with a bow-string, and so became sole
emperor. It is obvious that Jurgen, who was not born until 1235, could have

Another was the Dream Interpreter, born at Ephesus in the beginning of the

<font color="#007000">
<P>[BL]: The translation of the second line of the couplet
is rather weird, though the passage is quite
hard to be certain of.
"Posthumius idem, sed Marcus" can't possibly
be rendered as implying a name "Posthumius
Marcus" (an outrage against Roman nomenclature
anyway, since Marcus is a <i>first</i> or intimate name).
My rendering:</P>
<blockquote>
Saevius Posthumius (the same), though a Marcus
himself, will teach it.
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to render this use of "idem" neatly.  Certainly
it's far too free to render "docere" with "assert".</P>

It is reported, that in consequence of some infamy attached to
his character, he returned to Sardinia, and there ended his days.&quot;
Of this Saevius Nicanor nothing else is known, unless he is the Suevius
whom Macrobius describes as the author of an idyl, called
<I>Mulberry Grove</I>; observing that
&quot;the peach which Suevius reckons as a species of nuts, rather belongs
to the tribe of apples.&quot; Mr. Cabell pretends to translate <I>Taboo</I>

<blockquote>

<p>...about "Ettarre", the eternally pursued, ideal woman, it has,
not unnaturally, been suggested that she may represent some lost love of Cabell's youth
even as Felix Kennaston/Horvendile obviously is meant to represent Cabell
himself. This may or may not be so: at any rate, Cabellists usually derive
"Ettarre" from the medieval French romances. But only last week, I was browsing
through a reference work called
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000868SDW/" TARGET="_blank">
<i>Mythology of All Races</I></a> (Boston, 1918) and,

three chests of silver. In another saga the demon
king Raknar is found by the hero, fifty fathoms
under ground, seated in his ship surrounded by
five hundred of his men, who breathe jets of
vapor from their nostrils. The northern heroes
were not so lucky as Jurgen, for they found no

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahita" target="_blank">
Ana&iuml;tis</a></B> &mdash; Ana&iuml;tis,
or Anahita, was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">
Persian</a> goddess, and a feminine form, perhaps,
of the god
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithra" target="_blank">
Mithra</a>. She was a goddess of fertility
and of fertilizing waters; and, according to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta" target="_blank">
<I>Avesta</I></a>, purified the seed of males and the milk
of females, and was invoked by marriageable
girls, and by women at the time of childbirth.
She is described as a &quot;beautiful maiden, powerful
and tall, her girdle fastened high, wrapped
in a gold embroidered cloak, wearing earrings,
a necklace, and a crown of gold, and adorned
with thirty otter skins.&quot; At Erez, in Akilisene,
there was a sanctuary which contained a golden
statue of the goddess. To this sanctuary, which
was famous for its wealth, the daughters of the
noble families of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia" target="_blank">
Armenia</a> used to go and, as a
religious rite, prostitute themselves before their
marriage. Ana&iuml;tis was also worshiped in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia" target="_blank">
Cappadocia</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus" target="_blank">
Pontus</a>; and at

Zela</a>, in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus" target="_blank">
Pontus</a>, a
festival in her honor, the Sac&aelig;, was held annually.
It is hard to say just what grounds, other
than those of expediency, Mr. Cabell has for
connecting her with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake" target="_blank">
Lady of the Lake</a>. It
may be that, in very early times, the Lady of
the Lake was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_mythology" target="_blank">
Celtic goddess</a> of fertility (i.e.,
a love goddess), but all traces of this have disappeared
from the later
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthurian_legend" target="_blank">

seems that Mr. Cabell intends to present Ana&iuml;tis
as the universal love goddess, appearing under
different names and forms in different lands and
ages.</P>

Rendering "goddess of fertility" as "love goddess" <i>explicitly</i> is
strange.  They are not the same, and in the days when they were
"officially" confused as a sort of euphemism the former would not be
mentioned at all.  Similar considerations apply to goddesses of sex &ndash;
sexual desire, pleasure, and activity &ndash; which are yet a third thing.

[BL]:
The claim about "Sanctae Ursula et undecim mille virgines"
has been plausibly alternatively explained as a mis-reading
of something like "Sanctae Ursula et Undecimilla virgines".
I am seriously in doubt about "ursel" as relevant.  The
Greeks saw the Greater and Lesser She-bears
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major" target="_blank">Ursa
Major</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor" target="_blank">

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_%28mythology%29" target="_blank">
Pan</a>, the
Grecian god of plants and fields, whose unseen
presence caused &quot;Panic fear.&quot; But in <I>The High
Place</I> and <I>Something About Eve</I>, he clearly
becomes the everlasting spirit of evil in the
world, the &quot;adversary of all the gods of men,&quot;
whom Christians call
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan" target="_blank">
Satan</a>. In connection with

Adam</a></B> &mdash; In several
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism" target="_blank">
Gnostic</a> sects the
First Man &ndash; Anthropos or Adamas &ndash; occupied
a very important place. He stood for pure mind,
emanating from God and not yet darkened by
contact with matter. This First Man was often
confused with the Adam of the Scriptures, and
was described as &quot;the Christ, who was from the
beginning and is always; who was ever present
to every generation, in a hidden manner indeed,
yet ever present.&quot;

<p><font color="#007000">

"Anthropos" is simply "Human being", of course, and not
really a name.  It's more like a personification.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos" target="_blank">
Logos</a></B> &mdash; The Logos, in Hellenic and
Hebrew philosophy, seems to express the idea
of immanent reason in the world. Almost every
Gnostic and Christian writer of the early Church
gave it a different meaning. Some taught that it
was an emanation from God; some that it was
immanent in God; some that it was the counselor of God;
and some that it was the creative
power of God, which became the man Jesus.</P>

were followers of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius" target="_blank">
Arius</a>, an early leader in the Church, who held
that Christ was not one with God, but a lesser
god, created by Him. His doctrines were denied

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreus" target="_blank">

Dionysus</a>, whom
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus" target="_blank">
Zeus</a>, in the form

Persephone</a>
before she was carried off by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_%28mythology%29" target="_blank">
Pluto</a>. He

more generally called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_%28gnosticism%29" target="_blank">
Sophia Achamoth</a> &ndash; was, according
to certain branches of the Valentinians,
the fallen and degraded Sophia (i.e., divine
spirit), or the personification of the material
world. Achamoth was to be redeemed and lifted
into spiritual purity by marriage with Christ.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism" target="_blank">

<P><B>143</B> [<I>122</I>] <B>Kalakau</B> &mdash; According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica" target="_blank">
<I>The Encyclopedia Britannica</I></a>, the followers of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilides" target="_blank">
Basilid&ecirc;s</a> did
not regard Kalakau as a god or as a form of
Christ; but as a mystic word which Christ used
in His ascent to and descent from heaven. They
believed that, armed with this word, they could
conquer all the demons that sought to hinder
their passage to the highest heaven. Mr. Cabell
follows
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert" target="_blank">
Flaubert</a> who, in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptation_of_Saint_Anthony" target="_blank">
<I>The Temptation of St.

<P><B>143</B> [<I>122</I>]<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilides" target="_blank">
Basilid&ecirc;s</a></B> &mdash; Basilid&ecirc;s was one of the
most celebrated of the early
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism" target="_blank">
Gnostic</a> teachers.
He lived in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria" target="_blank">

<P><B>143</B> [<I>122</I>]<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism" target="_blank">
Docetes</a></B> &mdash; The Docet&ecirc;s were an early
heretical sect that maintained that Jesus Christ
was God only, and that His visible form was merely
a phantom.</P>

<P><B>143</B> [<I>122</I>] <B>Merinthians</B> &mdash; Merinthians was an
infrequent, and perhaps derogatory, name
(Merinthus &ndash; noose) applied to the Cerinthians,
the followers of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerinthus" target="_blank">
Cerinthus</a>. Cerinthus
taught that the world was not created by the
real God, but by one of God's inferior angels,
who became the God of the Jews; that Jesus was
a mortal, the son of Joseph and Mary, and that,
after his baptism, Christ descended to him in
the form of a dove.</P>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot" target="_blank">
Lancelot</a>
</B> &mdash; Sir Lancelot, son of King
Ban of

Benwick</a> and heir to the kingdom of
France, was the bravest and greatest of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur" target="_blank">
Arthur</a>'s

his mother by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake" target="_blank">
Lady of the Lake</a>, and
brought up by her in her domain of Fairyland.
His love for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guenevere" target="_blank">
Guenevere</a> caused the breaking up
of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Round_Table" target="_blank">
Fellowship of the Round Table</a>, and led
to the wars in which
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur" target="_blank">

<P><B>145</B> [<I>124</I>]<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockaigne" target="_blank">
Cocaigne</a></B> &mdash; Cocaigne was a medieval
Utopia wherein &quot;the rivers were of wine, the
houses were built of cake and barley-sugar, the
streets were paved with pastry, and the shops
supplied goods for nothing. Roast geese and
fowls wandered about inviting folks to eat them,
and buttered larks fell from the skies.&quot; The
name is now used to designate a land that is
perfect in every way.</P>

<P><B>149</B> [<I>127</I>]<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procris" target="_blank">
Procris</a></B> &mdash; According to the ancients,
the life of Procris was a series of domestic tragedies.
While her husband,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalus" target="_blank">
Cephalos</a>, was held
captive by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eos" target="_blank">
Eos</a>, the Dawn, who loved him,
Procris met
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos" target="_blank">
Minos</a> and cured him of an evil
charm, put upon him by his wife
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasiphae" target="_blank">
Pasipha&euml;</a>,
whereby he must fall in love with every woman
whom he saw and work harm by that loving.
Cephalos returned, disguised as another, and
successfully wooed his wife. When he threw off
the disguise, however, and revealed himself as
her husband, her affection for him was so genuine
that he forgave her for yielding. As a token
of her love she gave to him a magic javelin
which Minos had given her, and which could not
miss its mark. With this javelin he hunted so
frequently that Procris grew jealous. She followed
him upon one of his hunting trips and,
hiding near his hunting place, heard him invoking
the breeze. His words were ardent, and his
wife, not quite understanding them, thought
they were addressed to some more tangible
maiden. In her grief she forgot caution and
made a movement that caused the bushes to
rustle. Cephalos, thinking that some wild beast
made the sound, hurled his unerring javelin at
the spot and killed his wife.</P>

<P><B>149</B> [<I>127</I>]<B>

Minos</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasiphae" target="_blank">
Pasipha&euml;</a></B> &mdash; In classic
mythology, Minos aimed at supremacy over
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete" target="_blank">
Crete</a>, and declared that is was destined to him
by the gods, asserting as proof that the gods
always answered his prayers. In offering up a
sacrifice to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon" target="_blank">
Poseidon</a>, he prayed that a bull might
come forth from the sea, and promised to sacrifice
the beast. The bull appeared, and Minos
became king of Crete. However, his admiration
for the bull was so great that he kept him and
sacrificed another in his place; whereupon Poseidon
rendered the bull furious and made
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasiphae" target="_blank">
Pasipha&euml;</a>, the wife of Minos, conceive a passion
for the animal.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus" target="_blank">
Daedalus</a>, the artizan, constructed
a wooden cow, by means of which
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasiphae" target="_blank">
Pasipha&euml;</a>
might gratify her passion, and she became
the mother of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur" target="_blank">
Minotaur</a>, a monster half
animal and half man.</P>

name for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dung_beetle" tareget="_blank">
dung beetle</a>, or tumblebug, which
lays its egg in a ball of dung and compacts the
pellet by rolling it up hill with its hind legs and
allowing it to roll back down again. The Egyptians
compared the pellet to the sun, and held
the insect sacred to the sun-god. It is the original
of the well-known scarab. In the sixty-second

appears, under the name of Khypera, and shapes

<P><B>156</B> [<I>134</I>] <B>"There is no law in Cocaigne save, Do that which seems good to you."</B> &mdash;
See the entry for <b>Theleme</b>, page 187. Also, this
sounds like the "Wiccan Rede" (the following notes taken from
<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/wicrede.htm" target=_blank">this page)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>An it harm none, do what thou wilt.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
The original source for at least part of the Wiccan Rede appears to be
by a 16th century novelist, François Rabelais.</p>

<blockquote>
DO AS THOU WILT because men that are free, of gentle birth, well bred
and at home in civilized company possess a natural instinct that
inclines them to virtue and saves them from vice. This instinct they
name their honor.
</blockquote>

<p>
This concept appears to have been adopted by Aleister Crowley
(<i>Crowley was a Satanist, an occultist, and seems to have been at
best seriously misunderstood and at worst a rather creepy kook</i>)
(1875-1947) in his Law of Thelema which is contained in his 1904 book
<i>Liber AL vel Legis</i> (The Book of the Law). Many believe that Crowley
received the text of the Law from an angelic entity named Aiwass:</p>

<blockquote>
Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into
the word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the
Lover, and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of
the Law.
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the first of Crowley's two commandments is
<i>"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."</i></p>

<P><B>Comb</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Greek <i>kteis</i> or <i>cteis</i> means a comb, a yoni, or a comb
considered as a yonic symbol. In <i>Something About Eve: A Comedy of

John Davenport's
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0766175863/" TARGET="_blank">
Aphrodisiacs and Anti-Aphrodisiacs</a>
(Cabell's evident source) says:</p>

<blockquote>
Besides the lingham, the equally
significant <i>yoni</i> or <i>cteis</i> is to be seen, being the female organ of
generation. It is sometimes single, often in conjunction, for the
Indians, believing that the emblem of fecundity might be rendered more
energetic by combining the organs of both sexes, did so unite them,
giving to this double symbol the name of <i>pulleiar</i>, confounded by
some writers with the lingham itself. This pulleiar is highly
venerated by the sectarian worshippers of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siva" target="_blank">
Siva</a> (the third god of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti" target="_blank">
Trimourti</a>), who hang it round their neck as a charm or amulet, or,
enclosing it in a small box, fasten it upon their arm.
</blockquote>

<P><B>Taly</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
(Tamil ta&#772;li; in English also
spelt thali, tali): Again, John Davenport, Cabell's evident source:

<blockquote>
The Indians have also a little jewel called <i>taly</i>, worn, in like
manner, by females round their necks as a charm. It is presented to
them on their wedding day by their husbands, who receive it from the
hands of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin" target="_blank">
Brahmins</a>. Upon these jewels is engraved the
representation, either of the lingham or of the pulleiar.
</blockquote>

<p>Davenport
quotes Sonnerat's <i>Voyage aux Indes Orientales et &agrave; la
Chine</i>:

<blockquote>
A
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin" target="_blank">
Capuchin</a> missionary had a serious dispute the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit" target="_blank">
Jesuits</a> residing at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry" target="_blank">
Pondicherry</a>, which was referred for decision to the judicial courts.
The disciples of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola" target="_blank">
Loyola</a>, who can be toleration itself when toleration
furthers their crafty and ambitious views, had declined all
interference with the above custom. M. Tournon, the Pope's legate
apostolic, who regarded the matter as one not to be trifled with, and
with whom, moreover, the Jesuits were no favourites, strictly
prohibited the <i>taly</i>, enjoining all female converts to substitute in
its place either a cross or a medal of the Virgin. The Indian women,
strongly attached to their ancient customs, refused obedience. The
missionaries, apprehensive of losing the fruits of their zealous
labours, and seeing the number of their neophytes daily diminishing,
entered into a compromise by adopting a <i>mezzo-termine</i> with the
females in question, and it was agreed that a cross should be engraved
upon the <i>taly</i>, an arrangement by which the symbol of Christian
salvation was coupled with that of the male and female <i>pudenda</i>.

<P><B>202</B> [<I>175</I>] <B>Lares and Penates</B> &mdash;
The Lares and

Lares were regarded as the souls of ancestors;
while the Penates were more impersonal spirits.</P>

<P><B>203</B> [<I>176</I>] <B>Virgo</B> &mdash;

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutinus_Mutunus" target="_blank">

Mutinus was a Roman

Priapus</a>. The

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpocrates" target="_blank">

Harpocrates was the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus" target="_blank">
Har-pi-kruti
(Horace-the-Child)</a>. The Egyptian god was represented
with his finger to his mouth to indicate

made him the god of silence.</P>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaemonism" target="_blank">
Eud&aelig;monism</a></B> &mdash;
Eud&aelig;monism is an
ethical term given various meanings by various
philosophers. Mr. Cabell here seems to use it as
a synonym for hedonism in its narrowest form;
that is, the belief that man's highest good comes
from gratification of the senses. It is, however,
generally used to designate just the opposite of
this, and is applied to systems that regard mental
pleasure rather than sensual pleasure as the
chief desideratum.</P>

<P><B>208</B> [<I>180</I>]<B>

Silenus was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr" target="_blank">
Satyr</a> who always
accompanied the god Bacchus. He was a
jovial old man with a bald head and a blunt
nose. He was generally drunk, and as fat and
round as the wine bag he always carried with
him. He was an inspired prophet, who knew all
the past and the most distant future.</P>

<P><B>208</B> [<I>180</I>]<B>

In

Phenician</a> myth,
Protogonus was the son of the primeval deities,
Colpas and Bau (wind and night), and the
brother of Aeon, the first man.</P>

<P><B>211</B> [<I>183</I>] <B>&quot;Who this was&quot;</B> &mdash;
This new form
under which Sereda is masquerading is that of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele" target="_blank">
Cybele</a>, the Great Mother of the Gods. Cybele
was a goddess of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia" target="_blank">
Phrygian</a> origin, whose symbol,
a small meteoric stone, was transferred, in 204
B.C., from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessinus" target="_blank">
Pessinus</a> to Rome, in order to save
the latter city from invasion by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal" target="_blank">
Hannibal</a>. Her
worship, with that of her lover,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attis" target="_blank">
Attis</a> (whose
life and resurrection very closely paralleled
that of Christ), was one of the chief foes with
which Christianity had to contend. The priests
of Cybele and Attis were half-mad worshipers,
called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corybantes" target="_blank">
Corybantes</a>, and eunuchs, called Galloi,
who wore their hair long and dressed in women's
clothes. In their ceremonies, these priests danced
themselves into a frenzy, scourging and lacerating
themselves, hurling their bleeding, severed
members at the image of the goddess. It was
obviously just such a ceremony as this that so
terrified Jurgen.</P>

<p><font color="#007000">
[BL]:
Cybele again: the priests of Cybele (sometimes)
castrated themselves and made a votive offering
of their own scrota &ndash; not their "members", unless
it is being used in a generalised sense. I doubt
whether the scrota were thrown &ndash; I suspect they
were hung up among the other votive offerings
over her chest.  But maybe they did (they had
wild parties, those old priests of Cybele).

<P><B>217</B> [<I>188</I>] <B>Horvendile</B> &mdash;
Horvendile is the name
Mr. Cabell takes when he enters his own romances.
In reading of Horvendile is must be
remembered that he is always conscious that the
other characters are but creations of his own
imagination, and puppets with which he may do
as he pleases. This, of course, does not apply to

<font color="#007000">
<p>
[BL]:
Sorry to disappoint everyone, but "Horvendile"
(so spelt, anagram or not) is a late Frenchified
form of a name earlier attested as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurvandil" target="_blank">
Aurvandil</a>
or Orwandil.  This was a companion of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor" target="_blank">
Thor</a>
who suffered frost-bite in a journey.  Thor
broke off his great toe (or both of them?)
and threw it into the sky as a star.  It has
traditionally been identified with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Ursae_Majoris" target="_blank">
Alcor</a>, next
to the end of the handle in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper" target="_blank">
Big Dipper</a>.
The other toe is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel" target="_blank">
Rigel</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_%28constellation%29" target="_blank">
Orion</a>'s left foot,
if both toes are intended.</P>

<p>The name appears as the name of the star
itself later, and in Old English as "earendel",
in which form
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien" target="_blank">
Tolkien</a> found it, and eventually
produced the tale of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil" target="_blank">
E&auml;rendil the Mariner</a>, who
yet voyages over the world (or does he? the
cosmology isn't quite clear) with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silmaril" target="_blank">
Silmaril</a>
bound on his brow.  The transformation of
Orwandil's toe is one of the oddest known to
literature.</P>

<p>Cabell does refer to "the great toe of Horvendile"
somewhere.</P>

Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</a>:

<blockquote>

<b>BARATHRON</b>, also called ORUGMA, was a deep pit at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" target="_blank">
Athens</a>, with
hooks on the sides, into which criminals were cast. It was situate in
the demus <i>("dem" as in democracy; an administrative region?)</i>
&Kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&delta;&omega; <i>(or something
like that)</i>. It is mentioned as early as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">
Persian</a> wars, and
continued to be employed as a mode of punishment in the time of the
orators. The executioner was called <i>(a Greek phrase that I won't try
to enter)</i>. It corresponded to the Spartan <b>Ceadas</b> <i>(a deep cavern or
chasm into which the Spartans were accustomed to thrust persons
condemned to death)</i>.

He goes on to note that the term "Barathron" is
commemorated in astronomy in the terms "[peri/ap]barathron", meaning the 
extreme points of an orbit around a black hole.

"Lucifer" does NOT mean "the proud one".
(What a bizarre idea.)  It means "The bringer

that morning star / lucifer that knows no setting / fall".

Bast (AKA Bastet, Ailuros) is an important ancient Egyptian Goddess

Her goddess duty changed over the years, but she is also known as a

to at least the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Dynasty" target="_blank">
Second Dynasty</a> (c. 2890-2686 BC). She is most commonly
depicted with the body of young woman and the head of a domestic cat,

attached that jingle when shaken). Her cult center was in Bubastis.

<P><B>274</B> [<I>241</I>] <B>&quot;Temon!&quot; and &quot;Arigizator!&quot;</B> &mdash;
These words were fertility charms.</P>

<font color="#007000">
<p>[DC]: These words come from a passage cited in John Davenport's
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0766175863/" TARGET="_blank">
Aphrodisiacs and Anti-Aphrodisiacs</a>. They are given as counters to
anti-fertility charms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It must not be supposed that no counter-charms or amulets existed.
The curate Thiers, who has written at large upon this subject,
enumerates twenty-two different ones, the most potent of which were
the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]</p>
<ol>
<li value="9">
To write upon virgin parchment, before sunrise, and for nine days
successively, the word Arigazartor.
<li value="10">
To pronounce the word Temon three times successively at sunrise,
provided the day promises to be fine.

<P><B>274</B> [<I>241</I>] <B>Duda&iuml;m</B> &mdash;
Duda&iuml;m is a variety of melon,
having a small, fragrant, but inedible fruit.
It and eruca were supposed to be aphrodisiacs.</P>

<font color="#007000">
<p>[DC]: This is a Hebrew term for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake_%28plant%29" target="_blank">
mandrake</a>. Cabell again derives the term
from John Davenport:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Calmet, the word <i>Duda&iuml;m</i> may be properly deduced from
<i>Dudim</i> (pleasure of love); and the translators of the Septuagint and
the Vulgate render it by words equivalent to the English one &mdash;
mandrake. The word <i>Duda&iuml;m</i> is rendered in our authorized version by
the word mandrake
&mdash;
a translation sanctioned by the Septuagint, which, in this place,
translates <i>Duda&iuml;m</i> by [<i>m&ecirc;&#769;la
mandragor&ocirc;n</i>] mandrake&ndash;apples, and in
<i>Solomon's Song</i> by [<i>hoi mandrag&ograve;rai</i>] (mandrakes). With this,
Onkelos and the Syrian version agree; and this concurrence of
authorities, with the fact that the mandrake (<i>atropa mandragora</i>)
combines in itself all the circumstances and traditions required for
the Duda&iuml;m, has given to the current interpretation its present
prevalence.</p>

<p>Modern writers, as might be expected, have taken a very wide range in
their inquiries as to what kind of plant the Dudaïm really was, some
regarding it as lilies, roses, violets, snowdrops and jasmine; others
as melons, plaintain fruits, whirtleberries, dwarf brambles, the
berries of the physalis or winter cherry, grapes of some peculiar
kind, or even underground fungi, as truffles, etc. Many have supposed
the word to mean the ingredients, whatever they might have been, of a
charm or love-potion, and hence have recurred to the mandrake,
celebrated, as already said, throughout antiquity, for its supposed
virtues, and whose history has been tricked out with all the
traditional nonsense that might be imagined to confirm that report of
such qualities.</p>

Eruca</a></B> &mdash;
Eruca is a plant of the mustard
family. It was once supposed to possess
mystic properties.</P>

<font color="#007000">
<p>[DC]: Yet another borrowing from Davenport:</p>

<blockquote>
The plant
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arugula" target="_blank">
Rocket</a> (<i>brasica eruca</i>) has likewise been especially
celebrated by the ancient poets for possessing the virtue of restoring
vigour to the sexual organs, on which account it was consecrated to

  [BL]: This title is usually translated as
  &quot;The History of the Twelve Caesars&quot;,
  since there <i>were</I> only twelve.
  After these, the Emperors were no longer even adoptively of the family
  of the Caesari.  However, the name was revived (much too late for
  Suetonius) for the understudies to the Emperors, who styled themselves
  Augusti.
