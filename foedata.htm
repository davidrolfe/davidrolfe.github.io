<HR>

<A Name="Foreword"><CENTER><H2>Foreword</H2></CENTER>

<P>Today, in an age not given to credulity,
cynics argue that flowers lose their scent
under the microscope and that all the gods
are dead. Over the flowers we are willing to let the
poets and the botanists dispute; but in defense of the
gods we lift impatient voices. We know that they are
young again. The wizard Horvendile has called
them, and they have come. They have come, resurrected
into potent and living gods who will rule in
Poictesme forever. No atheist arises to deny them,
no upstart Hebrew can drive them from their altars.
From the four corners of the earth they have gathered
to reign in that last, great land where romance is, and
whose inhabitants are given to high adventure and
noble sins, and where no petty thing either good or
bad may enter.</P>

<P>That Horvendile has chosen most of his deities
and demons from hidden and orphic sources must be
evident to even the most casual reader. And so it was
with the purpose of helping the readers of <i>Figures
of Earth</i> become more familiar with these beings
that this book was prepared. It was not our object to
make plain the secret thaumaturgies or the black
magic which Miramon Lluagor uses, or to take aught
from the power and charm of Freydis by explaining
her; that were impossible. We were simply interested
in learning the divers abodes and attributes of the
different gods therein mentioned before they were
summoned to Poictesme by the charms of Horvendile.
And some of these, like Ettarre, have evaded us
at the last for many are the ways of their elusion.
These mysteries have defied all our attempts at solution,
and though we have used all our own incantations,
and though we have attacked them with prayer
and with fasting they still remain unresolved. The
magic of Horvendile only will avail against them,
and his magic is without price and is alone forever
uncircumvented.</P>

<P>Some there are, no doubt, who will feel that we
have been remiss innot mentioning the allegorical
passages in <i>Figures of Earth</i>. That, it is our belief,
is beyond the scope of the present work. Nor are we
altogether persuaded that Mr. Cabell's symbolism, if
indeed any symbolism is intended, requires exposition.
We can, in fact, hardly do better than refer those
interested to the Foreword of another volume of the
Biography, <I>Jurgen</I>. And in yet another place Mr.
Cabell has told us himself that his purpose was not
to teach or to moralise but on the contrary to &quot;write
perfectly of beautiful happening.&quot; This is an undertaking
which leaves scant time or energy for parables.
And so to those who must have a moral for their tale
we can only say: go seek elsewhere for here there is
no such thing; but only knowledge of resurrected
gods who, with Zeus and Ishtar, once ruled in lands
beyond the sea and whose power no man could measure.</P>

<P>Another Appendix we had planned to add, pointing
out where the reader might find each of those
&quot;fifteen or so experiments in contrapuntal prose,&quot;
whose long neglect so grieved their author. But while
this book was in the making, Mr. Warren A. McNeill
so perfectly accomplished this task in his <I>Cabellian
Harmonics</I> that any effort of ours to follow him
would be but vain repetition. To Mr. McNeill's
discussion of one of Mr. Cabell's poetic experiments,
however, we have been able to add materially. With
the valuable aid of Mr. Louis Untermeyer, we have
found the originals of the four parodies composing
the Rune of the Blackbirds; and here we wish most
sincerely to thank Mr. Untermeyer for his kindness in
helping us. To Dr. Tenny Frank, Dr. H. C. Lancaster,
and Dr. D. S. Blondheim, all of the Johns
Hopkins University, we also owe our deep gratitude
for suggestions and information so readily given. We
shall be equally grateful, too, to those readers who,
after having read this work, are able to help us fill
some of the embarrassing gaps that now appear too
frequently upon our pages.</P>

<P>The words that follow are listed in the order
of their first appearance in <i>Figures of
Earth</i>, the marginal numbers referring to
the pages of the Kalki edition of that book upon
which the words opposite them may first be found.
Where a word does not appear in the Kalki edition of
<B=i>Figures of Earth</i> but only in later editions, the
page number (enclosed in brackets) of the Storisende
edition is given. One asterisk indicates that the
word so marked occurs only in the Storisende edition;
while two asterisks indicate that it occurs in both the
Storisende and Illustrated editions but not in the
Kalki. The page numbers of all three editions may
be found in the Index.</P>

<P>To avoid confusion, words that are to be found in
both &quot;A foreword&quot; and the text of <i>Figures of
Earth</i>, have been omitted from the notes on the
former and dealt with as they appear in the narrative.
Words for which no origins have been found are
included in their proper places and a brief space has
been left after each, so that the reader may write
down any discoveries he may make concerning them.</P>

<P><b>XI</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>The Alum</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to the Author's
Note in the Storisende Edition of <i>Figures
of Earth</i>, this was Rockbridge Alum Springs,
Virginia. Here, too, it would seem from a certain
passage in <I>Straws and Prayerbooks</I>, was
written, at the same time, a portion of Mr.
Sinclair Lewis' <I>Main Street</I>.</P>

<P>[<b>XXI</b>]&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Kerin</B>**&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Layamon's <I>Brut</I> mentions a noble
of this name who was present at King Arthur's
coronation. Kerin is one of the cheif characters
of <I>The Silver Stallion</I>, and is a member of the
Fellowship. Besides being noted for his fighting
ability, he was also a great scholar.</P>

<P>[<b>XXI</b>]&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Ninzian</B>**&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Ninzian was the mildest and gentlest of all the champions of
<i>The Silver Stallion</i>, though we might expect otherwise
as he was the demon Surkrag in disguise.
Surkrag was originally a giant, the son of Cain,
and a commander over many wicked Jins.
However, he obeyed God and would not permit his
followers to harm the descendants of Adam.
In <i>The Silver Stallion</i> Mr. Cabell gives
an interesting reason for Surkrag's kindness
to humanity.</p>

<P><b>XII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Lewistam</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The name of John Frederick Lewistam is not to be found in the index
of the Library of Congress and is likewise missing from the
encyclopedias. Mr. Cabell, however, refers to him frequently as an
authority upon Poictesme, and apparently possesses a unique collection
of his works.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>"Hannibal Invaded," etc.</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The quotation is from the Foreward to <i>Main Street</i>.
The passage runs: "Main Street is the climax of civilization.
That this Ford car might stand in front of the Bon Ton Store,
Hannibal invaded Rom and Erasmus wrote in Oxford Cloisters."</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Frederick Barbarossa</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Frederick I (1123-1190) Roman Emperor, surnamed Barbarossa by the
Italians, was the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia.
The fact that he was a great hunter probably caused his confusion with
Barbatos.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Barbatos</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
One of the most powerful demons, who shows himself in the guise of a
hunter or archer. He commands thirty legions of demons, though he once
held a higher place. He knows both the past and the future.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Elijah</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Elijah the Tishbite was probably the foremost prophet among the
Hebrews, and is one of the two men mention in the
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/" TARGET="_blank">
Bible</a>
who did not
die. He was taken up to Heaven in a chariot of fire and a whirlwind.
In Slavonic folk-lore, during the transition fromg paganism to
Christianity, the Slavs attached the ideas and legends which had
gathered around the god Perum to the Prophet Elijah. The reason for
this may have been the fact that Perum was a harvest god and that the
day consecrated by the church to Elijah was July 20, which is also the
beginning of the harvest season.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Vayu</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Vedic god of wind or air. He was a fierce god whose chariot was
drawn by few or many horses, depending on the strength of the wind. He
was sometimes compared with the Teutonic Wodin-Odinn.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Perun</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Perun was thunder god of the Slavs. He was sometimes, however,
considered a god of the harvest. He swayed the elements, and drove
across the heavens in a flaming car, launching shafts of lightning at
his demon foes. Under Christianity, Perun became confused with the
Prophet Elijah.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Manu-Elul</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Vanderhoffen</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
For the history of Dr. Paul Vanderhoffen it is necessary to read the
tale called "A Princess of Grub Street," which is the ninth story in
Mr. Cabell's <i>That Certain Hour</i>. According to <i>The Lineage of
Lichfield</i> he was born in Augest 1780; changed his name, in 1803,
from Hilary Rudolph of Faxe-Kasselberg to Paul Vanderhoffen, thereby
abandoning his right to the throne; and died in January 1848.</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Rudra</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This Hindu god is variously called "the Howler," "the Ruddy One," and
"the board of the sky."  He is pictured as red colored, the sign of a
thunder god, blue necked and wearing a garment of skin. Concerning him
there are many legends.</P>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Magarko</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is a Russian demon whose eye is so powerful that he must always
be winking in order not to destroy whatever he is looking at. His name
means "the Winker."</p>

<P><b>XIII</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Vii</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Servian Vii, or Vy, is a monster whose glance is so powerful that
it reduces men, and even cities to ashes whenever it looks upon
them.</p>

<P><b>XIV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Nephthys</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
"Lady of the House" (of Horus). She was the daughter of Seb and Nut,
sister of Osiris, Isis and Set, and also the wife of the latter and
the mother of Anubis. She was looked upon as a protector of the dead.
Mr. Cabell's quotation of Dr. Budge, concerning her, was taken
directly from <i>A Dictionary of Non-Classical Mythology</i> by
Edwardes and Spence.</p>

<P><b>XIV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Dr. Budge</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge is a very famous English archaeologist,
Assyrian scholar, and writer on the mythology of all races. He has
carried out extensive excavations in Egypt, the Isle of Meroe, Semna,
and the Sudan. He was born July 27, 1857, and took his degree at
Christ College, Cambridge.</P>

<P><b>XIV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Nerthus</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The "Subterranean" or "Mother Earth," a goddess whom we are told by
Tacitus was worshipped by several German Tribes. She corresponds with
the Norse god Njordhr.</p>

<P><b>XIV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Charles Garnier</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Charles Jean Pierre Garnier is another of those scholars whose works
seem to be known only to Mr. Cabell. He is not to be confused with
Charles George Thomas Garnier, a French student of fairy lore.</p>

<P><b>XV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Codman</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The works of E. Noel Codman, thought frequently cited by our author,
apear not to be listed in the catalogues of our larger libraries.
Perhaps they can be found only in Mr. Cabell's unique collection of
authorities upon Poictesme.</p>

<P><b>XV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles" target="_blank">
Achilles</a>
</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The hero of the <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad" target="_blank">
Iliad</a></i>. His story is so well known it appears
unnecessary to give it here.</p>

<P><b>XV</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus" target="_blank">
Ulysses</a>
</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
One of the major Greek heroes of the Trojan war. His most celebrated
exploits, however, did not take place until after the struggle, but
occurred during his wanderings which are described in detail in
Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<P><b>3</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Poictesme</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is an imaginary land invented by Mr. Cabell to save him the
trouble of making his plots coincide with the geography of places
better known. "A Note upon Poictesme," serving as a foreword to the
illustrated edition of <i>The Silver Stallion</i>, deals at some
length with the land's origin; and the same book contains a copy of
the
<A HREF="jurmap.htm" TARGET="_blank">
map of Poictesme by Frank C. Pap&eacute;</a>.
There exists
<A HREF="jurmap.htm" TARGET="_blank">
another map, drawn by Mr. Cabell</a>.
"It was," Mr. Cabell confesses, "in the final months of 1905 that
Poictesme was born &mdash; of an illcit union between Poictiers and
Angoulesme." M. R&eacute;gis Michaud, in <i>The American Novel
To-day</i>, devotes some space to the "raw material" out of which this
fairyland was made. He writes: "The land of Poictesme ... is none the
less presented to us as a real country somewhere in Southern France.
Its half fictitious, half real boundaries are: on the north, England
of Arthurian times, on the south, the vague Asia Minor of Guy de
Lusignan and Melissinda, princess of Tripoli. The novelist has been
kind enough to design for the ignorant a map of Dom Manuel's domains.
According to the map, the land of Poictesme stretches along the
Mediterranean, between Aigues-Mortes and Cette. Its physical frontiers
are: to the west, the city of N&icirc;mes, and to the east, the twon
of Castres in Languedoc. Poictesme includes under fictitious names the
foot-hills of C&eacute;vennes, where we may recognize the haunts and
"high places" of Florian de Pusange.</p>

<P><b>3</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Manuel</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Of Manuel, since <i>Figures of Earth</i> is his life story, it is
necessary only to point out that he is the progenitor of all the
heroes &mdash; save Jurgen and those of the Fellowship of the Silver
Stallion &mdash; of Mr. Cabell's books; and that it is his life,
repeated again and again in the lives of his descendants, which forms
the subject matter of the Biography. However, it may be wise to add a
quotation from <i>The Lineage of Lichfield</i>, where Mr. Cabell says,
"Manuel ... I planned to be the type which find its sole, if
incomplete, been at some trouble to refrain from ascribing to Dom
Manuel any thoughts whatever." For a discussion of Manuel in his
r&ocirc;le of redeemer, see
<A HREF="#Appendix A" TARGET=DATA>
Appendix A</a>.</p>

<P><b>3</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Rathgor</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A town in Dublin County, Ireland.</p>

<P><b>3</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Lower Targamon</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Of this place we know only that is is mentioned in <i>The Silver
Stallion</i> as the realm of Prince Balien.</p>

<P><b>3</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Haranton</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In the enchanted forest of Broceliande in Brittany is the fountain of
Baranton, where, if legend be true, the wizard Merlin still sleeps.
Could this fountain of Baranton be the source of Mr. Cabell's "pool of
Haranton"?</p>

<P><b>5</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Geas</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A word from Irish folk-lore defined as meaning a metamorphosis,
enchantment, engagement, or charge. It appears to be used here in its
two latter meanings. It occurs frequently in the Irish tales and is
similar in effect to the better known Polynesian "taboo"; but where
the taboo is generally negative, a geas is positive. The taboo
forbids; the geas commands that, under certain circumstances, a
certain thing must be done.</p>

<P><b>5</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Ath Cliath</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Bally-Ath-Cliath-Duibhlinne, which is translated "The Town of the Ford
of Hurdles on the Blackwater," is an old name for Dublin.</p>

<P><b>5</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Firbolg</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to the legendary history of Ireland, the Firbolgs were the
third group of invaders to occupy the island. They were defeated and
driven out by the Tuatha De Danann or fairy peple. According to
another authority they were one of the three Nemedian families and
personified dullness and stupidity. The word is spelled Virbolg in the
Storisende edition. Is this an alternative spelling or simply a
misprint?</p>

<P><b>6</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Lock of hair</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The prominence which this lock of hair assumes in Manuel's story
naturally arouse curiosity about its significance. However, it is
possible here to offer only a probable solution of the problem. One of
the most widespread of primitive beliefs is that if a magician or
witch obtains the shorn hair of a person, her may, by sympathetic
magic, use that hair to injure its former owner. And in modern Europe,
hair seems to serve as a love charm. There is a German superstition to
the effect that a girl can make her lover call more frequently by
tearing out one of his hairs without his knowledge; while in Ireland
it is thought that if a hair so obtained is run through the fleshy
part of a dead man's leg, the person from whom it is takeit would seem
that so long as Suskind can keep Manuel's hair she can be sure of his
love for her and of her power over him. This would also help to
explain Manuel's effort to regain Melicent's hair in
<A HREF="#Chapter 38" TARGET=DATA>Chapter 38</a>.</p>

<P><b>6</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Norns</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
These are the Norse goddesses who correspond to the three Fates or
Moirae of Greek myth. Urd (hr) is goddess of the past; Verdandi,
goddess of the present; and Skuld, goddess of the future. They live at
the foot of their ash-tree, Yggdrasil; and in their book they write
the history and the fate of man, and there is no way to avoid this
fate. Mr. Cabell refers to them variously as: Norns, Fates, Gray
Three, Gray Weavers, and Daughters of Dvalinn.</p>

<P><b>6</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Sylan</B>*&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
It would seem that the Sylan is an exceptionally long-lived phantom
given to indulging in lewd and immoral adventures. Though it lives for
centuries, it is mortal and, having no soul, must simply vanish in the
end, unless it can, meanwhile, steal a soul from some man. Book Six of
<i>The Silver Stallion</i> is the best place to make the Sylan's
aquaintance, although he figures prominently in <i>Something About
Eve</i>. The word is obviously derived from sylen, for which see page
123 of <b>Figures of Earth</b>. Sylan does not appear in this book
prior to the Storisende edition.</p>

<P><b>7</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Count of Arnaye</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
There is in the west of France a place called Arnay-le-Duc which is,
no doubt, the origin of Mr. Cabell's Arnaye.</p>

<P><b>7</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Miramon Lluagor</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In the legend of Dom Manuel, this powerful magician seems to stand in
much the same relationship as Merlin stood in the Arthurian legends.
Although his championship of Manuel sometimes seems dubious; he is on
the whole Manuel's friend and aids him materially. A better picture of
Miramon's life and deeds may be obtained from <i>The Silver
Stallion</I>, in which he is one of the Fellowship.</p>

<font color="#007000">
<P>[DR]:
For additional comments, see also the entry for <b>Miramon Lluagor</b>
(page 71) in
<A HREF="jurgen.htm" TARGET="_top">Notes on <i>Jurgen</i></a>.</p>
</font>

<P><b>7</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Vraidex</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is the mountain on which Miramon Lluagor had his castle, and from
which he sent out his sleeps, nightmares, dreams, and madnesses. The
word itself would seem to have been coined from <i>vrai</i> meaning
truth and <i>dex</i> meaning ten; or possibly from <i>vrai</i> meaning
truth and <i>dix</i> meaning speak. From this we may conclude that the
magician's home was either founded upon ten truths or upon the fact
that he spoke the truth. The former, however, seems to be more
probable, because, according to the treaty by which Manuel held
Poictesme under Horvendile, "in Poictesme everything goes by tens
forever."</p>

<P><b>8</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Flamberge</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This sword, made by Galas, was one of the famous brands of
Charlemagne. Renaud, the son of Aymon, also had a sword called
Flamberge, but this is not the sowrd that figures in the annals of
Poictesme.</p>

<P><b>8</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Gis&egrave;le</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
More is to be learned of this lady in <i>The Silver Stallion</i>.</p>

<P><b>9</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Suskind</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is an anagram for "unkiss'd". It is also German for "sweet
child". The former is undoubtedly the real meaning, for on page 336 of
<b>Figures of Earth</b> we find Hinzelmann, brother to Suskind, in
speaking of her and her land on the other side of the window of Ageus,
contrast her with the women on Manuel's side, "where all <i>kissed</i>
women turn to stupid figures of warm earth."</p>

<P><b>10</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Count Manuel</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
It would seem that, to understand the expression, "your namesake the
famous Count Manuel that is so newly dead in the South yonder," we
must go to the end of the book. There, the dead Count Manuel, after
having tasted Lethe, beings to live all over again the life related in
<b>Figures of Earth</b>. So it would seem that it was Manuel himself
of whom the wizard was speaking.</p>

<H3><I><CENTER>Niafer</CENTER></I></H3>

<P><b>12</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Niafer</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The greater part of Niafer's history is to be found in this book.
However, in her old age, during the days told of in <i>The Silver
Stallion</i>, she exercised a great influence of Poictesme.</p>

<P><b>13</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Serpent of the East</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
See Norka.</p>

<P><b>14</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Norka</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Norka is a mythological beast of Russian folk-lore, although Mr.
Cabell here gives this name to another favorite villain of the
folk-tales, the Russian Snake. Norka's own form is not defined in the
tales but is left to the imagination; although in his particular story

His name is derived from the Russian for "otter." For a more detailed

<P><b>15</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Serpent of the North</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This Norse monster is Jormungand or the Midgard Serpent, one of Loki's
children. Odhin disposed of him by throwing him into the sea, where
he has grown so large that he encircles the earth.</p>

<P><b>16</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Gleipnir</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A rope made by the Mountain Spirits of the footfall of a cat, the
breath of a fish, the spittle of birds, the beards of women, the roots
of stones, and the nerves of bears. This rope was used by the
Scaninavian gods to bind the wolf, Fenris, a child of Loki's. Mr.
Cabell, not to be outdone in magic, turns it into a bridle and makes
it potent against Jormungand, a brother of Fenris.</p>

<P><b>17</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Middlegarth</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is obviously the Midgard of Norse mythology. It is that place
between Niflheim and Muspelheim which was destined to become the abode
of man.</p>

<P><b>18</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>"Old Man"</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
On page 315 this little old man is referred to as the Portune.
Portunes were demons who lives upon the earth in the forms of very
small old men in the guise of comfortable farmers. They were very
skillful and, despire their minute size, could accomplish more work
than could human beings. At evening, when their doors and windows were
locked, they would take little frogs out of their bosoms, roast them
at the coals, and eat them. They delighted in joining parties of
travelers at night and leading them astray.</p>

<P><b>19</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Dorothy of the White Arms</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
We learn form <i>The Lineage of Lichfield</i> that Manuel's mother was
also called Vraswen. For the somewhat peculiar circumstances
surrounding Manuel's birth, the curious are referred to Sir Thomas
Browne's <i>Vulgar Errors</I>, Book VII, Chapter XVI.</p>

<P><b>19</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Oriander</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This god's name will be found lacking in the mythological
dictionaries. Oriander, we are told in <i>A Bibliography of James
Branch Cabell</i>, was the name of the compositor which appeared on
the galley proofs of <i>Domnei</i>, and which Mr. Cabell promptly
changed into the appellation of a water demon. It seems necessary to
point out here that Manuel's mother was a virgin, and his father a
god.</p>

<P><b>19</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Mimir</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In Scandinavian myth, a giant who was the uncle of Odhin. He guarded
the well of wisdom at the foot of the world-tree, Yggdrasil, and by
daily drinking of its waters became the wisest of beings. When Mimir
was beheaded by the Vanir, Odhin took his head and, by means of
spells, gave it the power of speech. It became the god's oracle, and
from it he learned the most hidden truths. The fact that Mimir became
a trunkless head allows Mr. Cabell to confuse him later with the head
of Misery.</p>

<P><b>19</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>&AElig;sir</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is the generic name given to the Norse gods. The number is
uncertain, but is generally stated at twelve. Hence "&AElig;sir's
inverted bowl" would be the sky or heaven as it appears to us.</p>

<P><b>21</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Serpent of the West</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
See Maskanako.</p>

<P><b>21</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Hesperides</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Garden of the Hesperides was one of the names given to the Western
Paradise, a land beyond the setting sun, which Columbus identified
with America.</P>

<P><b>21</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Maskanako</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to the flood legend translated from the picture writing of
the Algonquins, the mighty serpent Maskanako came upon earth to stir
up strife among the living creatures. After it had caused all living
things to war against each other, it brought about a great flood which
spread over all the mountains. The daughter of a spirit helped a few
men and creatures into a boat, and all these cried out together, "Come
help, Manabozho!" This Manabozho was the creator of all men and
creatures. He was born a creeper and could move and live only on the
back of the great turtle, Tulapin, a sort of floating island. The
grandfather of all living creatures finally heard the cries of his
descendants and, bcoming frightened, ordered the turtle to restore
order to the universe. This Tulapin did, and the evil serpent,
Makanako, fled.</p>

<P><b>21</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Tulapin</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A great turtle in Algonquin myth. See Maskanako.</p>

Behemoth</a>

According to the legends of the Jews, Behemoth is the greatest of

his food, and all the water that flows through Jordan in a year he an
drink at a single gulp. At the end he will fight Leviathan and, the
animals killing each other, both will be served to the pious on the
Judgment Day. Behemoth is described in the

The l&eacute;shy were originally Russian wood sprites who played
malevolent tricks on travellers lost in the forests. In Mr. Cabell's
books, however, L&eacute;shy is a word used to describe any or all of
the supernatural beings who rules over Poictesme. It is, though, never
applied to gods who do not rule in this particular land.</p>

The great king and hero of the Franks. He lived from 742 to 814. He is

the Moors of Spain.</p>

<P><b>46</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Horvendile</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This name may come from the <i>Hystorie of Hamblet</i>, where a
Horvendile is governor of the province of Ditmarse and the father of
Hamblet. However, the name is written in <i>Chivalry</i> as Orvendile
and in <i>The Eagle's Shadow</i> as Orven Deal. A passage on page 273
of <b>Figures of Earth</b> also connects him with Scandinavian
mythology. There Manuel asks, "Is he the Horvendile whose great-toe is
the morning star?" This obviously refers to a passage in <i>The Prose
Edda</i>, where Thor carried Orvandel on his back in a basket from
Jotunheim. Orvandel's toe stuck out of the basket and froze, so Thor
broke it off and cast it into the sky, where it became a star. There
can be scarcely any doubt that Horvendile is Mr. Cabell himself,
entering his own books in masquerade. A careful reading of Book First
of <i>The Cream of the Jest</i> and other passages where he appears
will make this clear: and Mr. Cabell, writing of his books on page 10
of <i>The Lineage of Lichfield</i>, throws additional light on the
subject when he says, "Yet underlying all, of course, is the
profounder 'connecting theme' that Horvendile is the erratic demiurge
who composes and controls the entire business extempore, without any
prompter except his own &aelig;sthetic whim. . ." In a very interesting
discussion of Horvendile's origin in the Author's Note to the
Storisende edition of <i>Gallantry</i>, Mr. Cabell confesses that in
that book Vanringham foreshadowed Horvendile and played the author
loose in his own book; while Ahasuerus performed a similar function in
<i>Domnei</i>.</p>

<P><b>50</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Math</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is Manuel's half-sister Mathiette. There is no reason to suppose
that she is in any way connected with the Math of Welsh mythology. She
figures very slightly in this book and appears again in <i>The Silver
Stallion</i>.</p>

<P><b>51</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Alianora</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This person, though it appears that her contemporaries called her
Alianora, is known to history as Eleanor of Provence. The second
daughter of Raymond B&eacute;rengre IV of Provence, she married Henry
III of England in 1236, became the mother of Edward I in 1236, and in
1287, after Henry's death, entered the church at Ambresbury as a nun.
She died in 1291. Though brilliant and learned, as well as beautiful;
her ascendancy over her weak husband, her insistence on filling the
high offices of the realm with her own kinsmen and countrymen, and her
unscrupulous and constant efforts to obtain money, made her one of the
most unpopular queens that England ever had. She was, however,
charitable, humane, and a patron of the arts. There is no indication
that she was ever anything but a faithful and loving wife to King
Henry. Though Alianora, in the later chapters of <b>Figures of
Earth</b>, turns rather disconcertingly into an historical personage,
she is, when we first meet her, purely a fairy-store princess. The
legend of the Swan-Maidens, beautiful damsels who turned themselves
into swans by donning garments made of swans' feathers, and who were
captured when some hero stole their garments while they were bathing,
is to be found in the folk-lore of almost every European country. As
always, though, Mr. Cabell has improved upon the fairy story. See

A county in the southeast of ancient France.</p>

<P><b>51</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Aparasas</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In Hindu mythology these were beautiful nymph-like beings created by
Brahma, and were probably personifications of the mists and clouds.
Later they degenerated into more mundane creatures, beautiful maidens
who contributed to the sensual joys of Indra's pleasure grounds,
playing at dice and seeking contentment in the loves of mortals. The
Apsarasas of <b>Figures of Earth</b> seem to have little in common
with the Hindu cloud-maidens. See

<P><b>55</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Helmas</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Helmas, King of Albania, married a fay princess, Presina, whom he
found singing beside a fountain. After exacting his oath never to
visit her during childbirth, she became his wife. She gave brith to
three girls at once, M&eacute;lusine, Melior, and Plantina. A son of
Helmas by his former wife hurried to his father with the joyful news,
and the king, oblivious of his promise, rushed to his wife and found
her bathing her three children. Pressina exclaimed against his
forgetfulness, took her babes in her arms and vanished. When the
children were fifteeen she told them of their father's breach of
promise, and M&eacute;lusine, the youngest, determined on revenge.
She, in concert with her sisters, caught King Helmas and chained him
in the heart of the mountain called Avalon; or, as the German books
tell us, Brunbelois in Northumberland. The mother was so indignant at
this that she sentence M&eacute;lusine to spend each Saturday in
semi-fish form, until she should marry one who would not inquire into
what became of her on that day. In this tale Helmas is noted neither
for his wisdom nor his stupidity.</p>

<P><b>55</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Nevet</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;?</p>

<P><b>55</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Albania</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
An old name for Scotland. According to the

maps of Poictesme</a>,
Albania lay to the northwest of that land.</p>

<P><b>55</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Zhar-Ptitza</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is the fabulous Russian Fire-Bird, which slumbers by day and by
night flies about a world illumined by its glowing feathers. But the
bird on the pages of <b>Figures of Earth</b> has borrowed only its
name for the Zhar-Ptitza; it is really the Ph&oelig;nix as described
by Pliny. Speaking of this bird, the ancient writer says, "We are told
that this bird is of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant golden
plumage around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple
color; except the tail, which is azure, with long feathers
intermingled of a roseate hue; the throat is adorned with a crest, and
the head with a tuft of feathers. . . . It lives five hundred and
forty years, and when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and
sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its
body down upon them to die; from its bones and marrow there springs at
first a sort of worm, which in time changes into a little bird; and
the first thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its
predecessor, and to carry the next entire to the city of the Sun near
Panchaia, and there deposit it upon the altar of that divinity."</p>

<P><b>56</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Peohtes</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A warlike tribe of Scotland in pre-Arhurian times. They are mentioned
in Layamon's <i>Brut</i>.</p>

<P><b>57</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Brunbelois</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This was  originally a mountain in Northumberland, in the heart of
which Helmas was imprisoned by M&eacute;lusine. However, in <i>The
High Place</i> and <i>Domnei</i>, Mr. Cabell fables that
M&eacute;lusine, by a potent magic, transferred this mountain with all
its inhabitants from the land of the Peohtes to the midst of the
Forest of Acaire, in Poictesme. When Manuel visited it, it was
obviously situated in Albania.</p>

<P><b>57</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Pressina</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A water fairy. Her history has already been given under Helmas.</p>

<P><b>58</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Pavanes</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A grave and stately dance in which the dancers were elaborately
dressed. It was introduced into England in the sixteenth century.</p>

<P><b>58</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Branles</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Branle was a kind of generic dance which was capable of almost
infinite variety. In its original form it had steps like the
Allemande. It flourished about the middle of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<P><b>58</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Pazzamenos</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This was a corrupt form of Passemeasure or the Italian Passamezzo. It
was a slow dance of Italian origin, a variety of the Pavane.</p>

evidence that either had any dealings with an angel.</p>

<P><b>64</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Oriphiel</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In speaking of the loss of Oriphiel's feather, King Ferdinand refers
to the
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206;&version=9;" target="_blank">
second verse of the six chapter of Genesis</a>, where it says,
"The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and
they took them wives of all which they chose." The long lost
apochryphal Book of Enoch gives a very circumstantial account of this
intermarriage between angels and women; but the name of Oriphiel is
not mentioned in the list of those who led the fallen angels. The
corrupted Slavic version of the Book of Enoch mentions the incident
but does not name any of the angels.</p>

<P><b>66</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Duke Asmund</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
There were any number of Northmen with this name, the most important,
however, being Asmund Longhair, the father of Grettir in the <i>Saga

ascribed to Petronius and reads, <i>"Mundus vult decipi, ergo

Raymond B&eacute;renger's wife, Beatrice, was considered a woman of

This was the name of several of the Counts of Provence in the tenth
century. The most important of these was the father of Rouboud, or
Rothbold, who, with his son, was able to make headway, where all
others had failed, against the Saracens who had invaded Provence about
that time.</p>

<P><b>92</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Schamir</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to the stories of the Rabbis, schamir was the instrument
used by Solomon to hew the stones of the Temple after he had been
forbidden to hew them with iron or any other metal. It was a worm of
the size of a barley corn but so powerful that the strongest flint
could not resist it. However, Mr. Cabell seems to apply the name of
schamir to a stone of similar potency told of in Iceland, which gives
its owner almost unlimited powers, including the power of restoring
life. See
<A HREF="#Appendix C" TARGET=DATA>
Appendix C</a>.</p>

<P><b>94</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Freydis</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This name was probably taken from the <i>Heimskringla</i>, where a
Freydis is the sister of Leif Ericson, the reputed discoverer of
America. This woman, who was haughty and avaricious, continually
stirring up strife and not hesitating at murder, in no way resembles
Queen Freydis of Audela. Mr. Cabell seems to confuse Freydis with
Hecate, giving her many of the attributes of the grim goddess of the
crossroads and, on page 116, making her answer an invocation usually
addressed to the witch-goddess. It would seem, too, that Freydis is
meant to personify artistic inspiration, especially of the literary
kind; and that her fire was the fire of genius, and her followers men
of letters.</p>

<P><b>94</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Audela</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This name of the country which Freydis ruled beyond the fire is made
by simply running together "<i>au de la</i>," the French for "over
there." It was an expression used quite extensively by spiritualists
in the early part of the twentiesh century to designate the spirit
world. Mr. Cabell, it is safe to guess, uses it with no such
meaning.</P>

<P><b>95</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Torolix, Ciccabau, Tio, Tio,
Torolililix</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The charm which Alianora used to call together the birds is evidently
taken from Arisophanes' <i>The Birds</i>. It is there used by the
Nightingale and the Hoopoe for the same purpose. In line 237 we find
"Tio" repeated eight times; in line 243 we find "Trioto, trioto,
totolinx"; and in lines 259, 260, and 261 we have
<blockquote>
"Toro toro toro torotinx<br>
Kikkabau, Kikkabau<br>
Toro toro toro toro lililinx."
</blockquote>

<P><b>96</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>The Eagle's Axions</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This paragraph, dealing with the eagle's efforts to find an
appropriate motto, apparently parodies the utterances of Woodrow
Wilson during the World War.</p>

<P><b>98</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Jahveh</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Jahveh is supposed to be the correct form of the word Jehovah and, as
such, is the name of the God of the Old Testament. It is used her in
that sense, but occasionally Mr. Cabell does not use it so. He
sometimes uses Jahveh to designate the God of the modern reactionary
Fundamentalists, as opposed to the deity of the more enlightened
sects.</P>

<P><b>99</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel" target="_blank">
Gabriel</a>
</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In Jewish and Christian tradition Gabriel is one of the seven
archangels; and he is believed by the Mohammedans to have dictated the
Koran to the Prophet. He is generally pictured as the messenger who
will, on the last day, call mankind to judgment with his trumpet.</p>

<P><b>100</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh" target="_blank">
Nineveh</a></B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The ancient capital of Assyria on the left bank of the Tigris. It was
a great commercial center for more than 200 years. The city fell and
was destroyed in B.C. 608.</p>

<P><b>101</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Solomon</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
See Suleiman-ben-Daoud (next).</p>

<P><b>102</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Suleiman-ben-Daoud</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is, quite obviously, an English transliteration of the Hebrew
characters which are generally translated Solomon, son of David. The
reference here is to Solomon's obvious character as displayed in <a

<P><b>104</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Bishop of Ely</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Bishop Hugh of Ely was one of those sent by the King of England,
Henry&nbsp;III, in 1236 to escort Eleanor of Provence (Alianora) to
England.</p>

<P><b>104</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Bishop of Lincoln</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Mr. Cabell here follows <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Strickland"
target="_blank">Agnes Strickland</a> in her <i>Lives of the Queens of
England</i> <font color="#007000">[in 12 volumes, from 1840 to 1848; here's <a

target="_blank">Vol. 5 on Amazon</a> &mdash;DR]</font> in making the
Bishop of LIncoln part of Alianora's escort. Matthew Paris gives the
title of this ambassador as Bishop of Hereford. See Prior of Hurle
(next).</p>

<P><b>104</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Prior of Hurle</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to Matthew Paris, Henry&nbsp;III sent Richard, Prior of
Hurle secretly to negotiate with Raymond B&eacute;renger&nbsp;IV for
the hand of Raymond's daughter, Eleanor (Alianora). He succeeded so
well that upon his return to England he was sent back with other
messengers, "namely, the Bishops Hugh of Ely and Robert of Hereford,
and brother of Robert de Sanford, the master of the Knights Templars,"
publicly to make his proposal for the lady's hand and to escort her to
England.</p>

<P><b>104</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>King of England</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This was Henry&nbsp;III.</p>

<P><b>104</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Sancha</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Sancha, the youngest daughter of Raymond B&eacute;renger, became,
through the influence of her sister Alianora, the second wife of King
Henry's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall; and for a while the noble
sisters, through the influence they possessed with their husbands,
were able to rule England as they pleased. Sancha and her husband
seems to have possessed the purely nominal titles of Queen and King of
the Romands.</p>

<P><b>105</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Beatrice</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This Beatrice, the daughter of the one mentioned on page 87, married
Charles of Anjou, who later became Charles&nbsp;I, King of Naples.</p>

<P><b>106</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Jephthah's Sacrifice</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Jephthah was a judge of Israel who sacrificed his only daughter to
Jehovah. The store is told in Judges&nbsp;XI, 30-40.</p>

<P><b>112</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Cendal</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A fabric similar to taffeta used in medieval weaving.</p>

<P><b>112</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Sarcenet</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
A kind of fine thin silk fabric used for linings.</p>

<P><b>112</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Brunet</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is apparently the color of the material. It is, according to
French dictionaries, brownish or dark.</p>

<H3><I><CENTER>What Helmas Directed</CENTER></I></H3>

<P><b>114</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>M&eacute;lusine</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
M&eacute;lusine, the heroine of the Lusignan legend, was one of the
most famous fairies of France, and the noblest families were proud to
claim descent from her. For imprisoning her father, Helmas, she was
condemned by her mother to spend each Saturday in the form of a fish
from the waist downward. While presiding over the fountain of which
she was the fairy, she met and saved from great peril Raymond, Count
de la For&ecirc;t. She consented to wed Raymond upon the condition
that he should never visit her on Saturdays, and, after their wedding,
she built around her fountain the castle of Lusignan. Here
M&eacute;lusine and Raymond lived happily many years, becoming the
parents of several sons, all of whom, however, were deformed. At last,
though, Raymond was persuaded to spy upon his wife and, one Saturday,
saw her in her bath, her lower extremities changed into the tail of a
great fish or serpent. When he reproached her with this, she vanished
from the castle; never to return save as a phantom to prophesy some
woe to the race of Lusignan. Mr. Cabell has, of course, take liberties
with this legend.</p>

<P><b>115</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Thick book</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The "thick book wherein was magic" was probably&nbsp;&mdash; somewhat
anachronistically&nbsp;&mdash; Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, since
all the information which Helmas furnished Manuel may be found in that
volume under the word "queen".</p>

<P><b>115</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Cwen</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
According to Webster this was Anglo-Saxon for "wife," "queen," or
"woman."</p>

<P><b>115</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Morven</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This was once the name applied to all the northwest of Scotland. It
means "a ridge of high hills" and was the realm of Fingal. Mr. Cabell
has placed it within the boundaries of Poictesme.</p>

<P><b>115</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Vel-Tynos</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This is an anagram of "novelty." <font color="#007000">[See also page
230 of <i>Notes on Jurgen</i>.]</font> According to Cabellian mythology,
Vel-Tyno is one of the gods of Philistia and, with Sesphra and Ageus,
forms the Trinity of the Shephelah, which is worshipped cheifly in
that land.</P>

<a name="MoonChildren">
<P><b>116</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Moon-Children</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The Scandinavians, according to <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160206797X/"
target="_blank">Curious Myths of the Middle Ages</a>, tell the
following story to explain the spots on the moon. "Mani, the moon,
stole two children from their parents and carried them up to heaven.
Their names were
<A HREF="#BilAndHjuki" TARGET=DATA>
Hjuki and Bil</a>. They were drawing water from the well
Byrgir, in the bucket Soegr, suspended from the pole Simul, which they
bore upon their shoulders. These children, pole, and bucket were
placed in heaven 'where they could be seen on earth.'" It later
becomes evident that this is the myth referred to.</p>

<P><b>116</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Invocation</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The words used by Manuel to call Freydis forth from the fire are those
of an old invocation to Hecate, a moon goddess who possessed all the
attributes of the ancient and medieval witches. The spell was uttered
in a grove of laurel boughs, at the time of the full moon, over a
small statue of the root of the wild rue annointed with a paste made
of myrrh, storax, incense, and the crushed bodies of lizards. It would
seem that Mr. Cabell has made some slight changes in the words of the
invocation, but these do not in the least change its sense. Bombo,
Gorgo, and Mormo occur in the original invocation and are obviously
appellations of Hecate.</P>

lists these in a collection of ghosts, goblins, spirits, "and such
other Bugs" which are used to frighten children. The passage occurs in
Book&nbsp;VII, XV., on page 122 of the 1886 edition.</p>

These are also in Scot's list of goblins.</p>

<P><b>123</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Sylens</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
These are also mentioned by Scot, but are to be found elsewhere. The
word, sylen, is thought to be a corruption of "Sylham lights," a name
given to the <i>ignes fatui</i> on account of their frequent occurence
near the town of Sylham in Suffolk. This word has been dropped from
the Storisende edition to avoid confusion with Sylan.</p>

<P><b>[101]</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Trows*</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;

<P><b>124</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>"A penny, a penny"</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Or, in full: "A penny, a penny, two pence and a half, and a half
penny." It was an Irish fairy charm or song and is a translation of
"pighin, pighin, da pighin, pighin go leith, agus leith pighin."</p>

<P><b>124</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Bellegarde</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
There are at present at least threee towns of this name in France.</p>

<P><b>131</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Mohammed's mare</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Al Borak, the Lightning, was the name of the mare upon which, legend
says, Mohammed was mounted when he ascended to Heaven to learn the
will of God. It is said to be one of the animals admitted to
Paradise.</p>

<P><b>131</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Hrimfaxi</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
Hrimfaxi, or Frost Mane, is the horse that draws the dark charior of
the Scandinavian goddess Nott, or Night.It is thought that from his
bit and long flowing mane the rime drops fall upon the earth.</p>

<P><b>131</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Balaam's ass</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This ass because of its powers of perception saved the life of its
master and was granted the power of speech to remonstrate with him for
beating it. Because of its service to its master it was, along with
Mohammed's Mare, admitted into Paradise. The story of Balaam and his
steed is in Numbers&nbsp;XXII, 21-24.</p>

<P><b>131</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Pegasus</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
The winged horse which sprange from the blood of Medusa, when her head
was struck off by Perseus. Bellerophon caught Pegasus with a golden
bridle given him by Athena and used him to help in slaying the
Chimera. Because the inspiring fountain of Hippocrene sprang from one
of his foot prints, Pegasus is thought to be the steed of the Muses,
and is often identified with poets.</p>

<P><b>133</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>Gryphon</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
This was a fabulous monster half eagle and half lion; a kind of
griffin. The belief in these animals came from the East where they are
mentioned among the monsters guarding the treasure of India.</p>

<P><b>136</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<B>"Borram, borram," etc.</B>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;
In an Irish fairy tale, the word borram, repeated three times, is a
charm used by a fairy to turn rushes into horses. In Irish fairy lore,
the Leanhaun Shee is the Fairy Mistress, one of the dreadful solitary
fairies. She seeks the love of mortals and those who love her
become great poets, but they die young, for she lives upon the vitals
of her victims. All the great Irish poets have been her lovers.
Freydis has undoubtedly inherited some of the characteristics of the
Leanhaun Shee.
