<p><i>"I have finished </i><B>Jurgen</b><i>; a great and beautiful book, and the saddest
book I ever read. I don't know why, exactly. The book hurts me &ndash; tears
me to small pieces &ndash; but somehow it sets me free. It says the word
that I've been trying to pronounce for so long. It tells me everything
I am, and have been, and may be, unsparingly...I don't know why I cry
over it so much. It's too &ndash; something-or-other &ndash; to stand. I've been
sitting here tonight, reading it aloud, with the tears streaming down
my face..."</i></p>
